   In the terminal, run:
   ```bash
   cd UCONN-course-scheduler
   ```
5. **Build and Run Docker Containers**
     
Execute the following commands one by one. The first two commands may take some time to runâ€”be patient and wait until each finishes before proceeding to the next. **Make sure to include the period at the end of the build commands.**
```bash
docker build -f Containerization/Dockerfile.frontend -t frontend .
```
```bash
docker build -f Containerization/Dockerfile.backend -t backend .
```
```bash
docker run -d -p 5173:5173 frontend
```
```bash
docker run -d -p 5123:5123 backend
```
